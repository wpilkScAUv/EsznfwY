# Assignment and Project

| No | Topic | Title | Files |
| -----: | ----- | ----- | :------: | 
| 1 | Your personal web page | You are required to create a page about yourself. This assignment is fun and fairly open-ended: you get to design what you like, with a few specific requirements. The purpose is to give you practice writing basic HTML code. You will also gain experience with the tools for text editing. |<a href="" ><img src="../images/html64.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a><a href="" ><img src="../images/pdf64.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 2 | Adding CSS to Your Web Page | The second assignment is to improve the Web page you created last time. You will copy your page from assignment 1, add another HTML page to the folder, linking both pages together, and then style them with CSS. |<a href="" ><img src="../images/html64.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a><a href="" ><img src="../images/pdf64.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
